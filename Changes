      - Added `t/basic.t` so that it would actually be distributed. Duh.

1.01  2008-02-04 22:08:44
      - Added `t/basic.t`, which just makes sure the bundle module loads, so
        that there is at least one test for the distribution. This will
        eliminate those "UNKNOWN" test retults from cpan-testers.
      - Changed the "CONTENTS" header to uppercase to make `CPAN.pm` happy.
      - Added Module::Install.
      - Added CPAN::SQLite.

1.00  2008-02-03 01:59:58
      - Initial public release.
